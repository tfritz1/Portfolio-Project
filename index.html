      <h2 class="text-center"> About Me</h2>
      <p> After graduating college, I decided to get a job as a lab tech and research assistant at Indiana University Bloomington. While working, I began teaching myself Python and taking multiple online courses. This led me to want a career as a software engineer.</p>
